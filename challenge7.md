## Solution - Detailed Steps
1. **Enable Bastion Host in Terraform** 
- Edit cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars

- Switch the challenge flag to true
```
bastion_enabled = true
```

2. **Run Command terraform apply**
   
   By run this command, it throw a error ` Error: "policy" contains an invalid JSON: invalid character '\n' in string literal `. This is because of the ` USER_IP ` variable.
   Then, I config `USER_I` manually and  after then agin run command `terraform apply` after that i got `Apply complete` message and `output`

3. **Install Cloudfox**
   
   For install cloudfox I webt to github link `https://github.com/BishopFox/cloudfox/releases` and download `cloudfox-linux-amd64.zip` after that i use unzip command and move cloudfox to  `/usr/local/bin`
   comand are given below
   ```
   unzip cloudfox-linux-amd64.zip
   sudo mv ~/cloudfox/cloudfox /usr/local/bin
   cloudfox --version
   ```
4. **Find Instance ID**
   
   By running command given below to list out the instances and find the instance ID:
   ```
   cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable instances -v2
   ```
   After running this command the loot is cached
   
   ```
   [instances][cloudfoxable] Loot written to [/home/vikram/.cloudfox/cloudfox-output/aws/cloudfoxable-135808940242/loot/instances-ec2PrivateIPs.txt]

   [instances][cloudfoxable] Loot written to [/home/vikram/.cloudfox/cloudfox-output/aws/cloudfoxable-135808940242/loot/instances-ec2PublicIPs.txt]

   [instances][cloudfoxable] Loot written to [/home/vikram/.cloudfox/cloudfox-output/aws/cloudfoxable-135808940242/loot/instances-ssmCommands.txt]

   [instances][cloudfoxable] Loot written to [/home/vikram/.cloudfox/cloudfox-output/aws/cloudfoxable-135808940242/loot/instances-ec2InstanceConnectCommands.txt]
   ```

5. **Install Session Manager Plugin and Use the SSM Command**

   I follow the AWS documentation to install the Session Manager plugin by using below given commands
   ```
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
   sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
   ```
   To verify the Session Manager plugin is installed or not I use
   
   ```
   session-manager-plugin
   ```
   It give a this message `The Session Manager plugin is installed successfully. Use the AWS CLI to start a session.` which means plugin installed.
   
   To Connect instance with SSM
   
   ```
   aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>
   
   ```
   my instance id = i-0d42eb03155132c37

6. **Check Permissions**  
   by run this command to check the instanceâ€™s permissions:
   ```
   cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable permissions --principal [NameOfInstanceRole]
   ```
   NameOfInstanceRole = bastion
   
 
7. **Access the S3 Bucket**
   by the above step identify instance has the necessary permissions to access an S3 bucket.
   List the contents of the S3 bucket:
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
   ```
   
   This is my bucket name with command
   
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://cloudfoxable-bastion-9hypj
   ```
   
   Then i Found a flag.txt file then i copied that file and found the flag name by using command
   
   ```
   aws s3 cp s3://cloudfoxable-bastion-9hypj/flag.txt -

   ```

   I found the flag that is `{FLAG:bastion::ifYouHaveAccessToAnEC2YouHaveAccessToItsIamPermissions}`
